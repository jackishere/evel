Minimal Express server.

## Stack
- Node.js / Express
- Port 3000 (default)

## Commands
- `npm start` — start the server
- `npm test` — run tests (if any)

## Guidelines
- Keep it simple
- Test endpoints after changes

## Commits
EVERY commit must be handled exclusively by the `code-commiter` agent. Never execute mutating git commands (commit, push, merge, rebase, reset, etc.) directly. The agent must output the exact command and parameters for the user to copy and run themselves.
